# Pet-Mind-Sales-Analysis

Project Description:
This project was an analysis conducted for the client PetMind, a pet products retailer based in the United States. PetMind sells a variety of products, including luxury items such as pet toys, and everyday items such as pet food.

The main objective of this project was to help PetMind increase their sales by focusing on selling everyday products on a recurring basis. Over the past year, the company has been testing this approach, and now they want to get a report that illustrates the impact that repeat purchases have on their sales.
